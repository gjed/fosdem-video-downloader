# FOSDEM Video Downloader

A Python tool to download FOSDEM conference videos from an ICS schedule file. It
is designed to work with the ICS export of bookmarked talks from the

## Features

- Downloads FOSDEM videos from your bookmarked talks
- Uses the official FOSDEM schedule and video URLs

This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.
